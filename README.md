# Closedverse
This isn't finished yet. Meant to be a random out-of-the-blue parody of Openverse that's supposed to be unironically better than Openverse, before Openverse even has hosting.

# Requirements
Always remember to format and use clean coding practices <br>

# Usage
It's a standard Django app. <br><br>
Make the config, migrate, then either runserver or run it in uWSGI. If you don't know how to set up a Django app, look it up please.
